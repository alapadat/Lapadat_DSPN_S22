    "Grouping total household income (HHINC) and household income quintiles (HPCTCUT) + top 5% of households () **by** GESTFIPS (50 states + 6 territories) and GTCBSA (metropolitan area) + GTCBSAST (metropolitan area/areas people spend most of their lives in), as well as the size of that metropolitan area (GTCBSASZ):\n",

    "### Hypothesis 1-A: Income ~ Disorders\n",

    "### Hypothesis 1-B: HH Income ~ Discouraged worker\n",
    "Lower household income correlates to higher rates of discouraged workers (PRDISC).\n",

    "Lower HH income correlates to higher rates of unemployment and, as poverty increases, people not in labor force, part time for non-economic reasons etc [in the categorical variable unemployment type (PRUNTYPE)]. This is positively correlated to with how many children are in that person's family (universe: all families) and HH. However, I expect that correlation to lessen as we increase in income level and quintiles. I expect no relationship or low statistical significance and little correlation for the top 5% of earners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reasoning\n",
    "Where people live, defined by their state/territory and the metropolitan area/s people live in, as well as the size of those areas, predict disorders. I expect to see a correlation where, if I were to look at the metropolitan areas with the fewest disorders, the wealth of those areas (not in model) would be the underlying factor predicting disorders.\n",

    "I think this is fairly weak and even redundant, but would provide useful information when we **group people's income by their metropolitan area.** Then it would be no longer redundant and this sentence is moot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis 2: Unions ~ better outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Union coverage (A_UNCOV) universally (across all HH and personal income levels) predicts higher positive outcomes v. non-union coverage. Union membership (A_UNMEM) predicts the same, but to a marginally higher degree.\n",

    "Follows the same pattern as Hypothesis 1-A, where union coverage and/or membership predict fewer disorders v. non-unionized persons.\n",

I expect union workers hours/week worked (A_USLHRS) to plateau after 40-50, and the ceiling for non-union workers should be significantly higher. Will have to adjust for the size differences in union-represented v. non-union represented labor force members, as the total *n* of union-represented members is much lower.\n",
